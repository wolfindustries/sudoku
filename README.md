# One-File Sudoku

## Description
A single file game of Sudoku I started writing because my internet went down and I was already getting sick of ads in the Microsoft Sudoku App. Written entirely in a single HTML file with zero dependencies, so just open it up and play.

## Installation
Download the file.

## Usage
Open the file, play the game, have fun, enjoy.

## License

## Contributions
IDK I think I can handle it
